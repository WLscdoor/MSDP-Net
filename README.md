# MSDP-Net
This repository implements MSDP-Net, a novel multi-scale domain perception network for high-resolution range profile (HRRP)-based radar automatic target recognition, which jointly models spatial and spectral characteristics through a hybrid DP-HRRP encoder and hierarchical scale fusion. The work has been accepted by Remote Sensing.
